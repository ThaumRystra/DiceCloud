If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a *wall of fire* are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\n***Spells.*** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\n***Magic Items.*** The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.

A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the *rope trick* spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n\n***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.

The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful DC {DC} Intelligence (Investigation) check to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell glyph*.\n\n***Explosive Runes.*** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC {DC} Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n***Spell Glyph.*** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 41h level or higher, the damage of an *explosive runes* glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level  above 3rd. If you create a *spell glyph*, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the *glyph of warding*.\n\n---\n[Errata](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/PH-Errata.pdf)",

The gemstone can’t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\n***Slumber.*** The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n\n***Ending the Spell.*** During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.

You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\n\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\n\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\n\nDuring this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception; if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring a DC {DC} Intelligence (Investigation) check DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\n***Death.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\n***Discord.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\n***Fear.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\n***Hopelessness.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n\n***Insanity.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n\n***Pain.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\n***Sleep.*** Each target must make a DC {DC} Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\n***On Target***. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\n***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\n***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\n***Mishap.*** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *greater restoration* spell.\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last tum). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *wish* spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1dlO necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
